			<h3>  Just a little about who I am.</h3>
		</header>
		<center>
		<p>Hello everybody, I want to welcome you to my website.</p></center>
			<p>I'm an Artist/Designer I've  been drawing since I can remember.
			<br />I have always wanted to teach drawing in away that focused on the fundamentals of drawing/designing.
				I like keeping the process simple, well as simple as I can.
			<br  />I will be working with the basic elements and I will be using drawing principles to help focus our elements with the use of grid lines
					 to help with scale, proportions which are principles.
					I will give tutorial taking you through all the steps from concept to a level where you can communicate your idea's using the elements 
			<br />lines, shape and form and principles contrast, scale, proportions. I will be focusing on combining both sketching on paper, cardboard, any surface and we will be using computer to speed up the process and hopefully save lots of paper. </p>
						
			<p>I am targeting beginners, people young and old,
			<br />anybody who would like to communicated their ideas with drawing and designing.
			<br/>It's a wonderful and rewarding process, to take elements from nature and  transform those element into something functional, stylish.
			<br />My wish is to help change how you see the world, or a least how we could see the world through drawing and designing...</p>	

			<p>I want to help you, that's my primary objective. I'm here to develop my skill also, we never really stop learning, and that's true for artist and designer too!
			<br />Imagine if there were nothing to learn...BORING!!
			<br /> I hope you find my process an enjoyable one. I hate saying this but practice really does help, I will be repeating myself over and over so that the process is understood.</p>
				
			<p>So get you pencils sharpened and let get scribbling!!</p>
